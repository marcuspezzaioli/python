Running this file will zip the files stored in the 'filestozip' directory and save them to the 'zippedfiles' directory.
It has been set up to store 5 files in a zip file before creating a new zip file to store the next 5 files.

Errors can easily occur when working with file paths, and one will get thrown here if the required folders can not be found.

It is important therefore, that if you want to use this file without making any changes to it that you follow a similar structure to this. 
There needs to be a filestozip and a zippedfiles directory inside of the same directory where createzippedfiles.py is based.
